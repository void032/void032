### 🧠 About Me

I’m a full-stack developer who prefers building over talking.  
I work with AI, web technologies, and automation tools that actually solve problems.

- 👨‍💻 Comfortable across frontend & backend
- 🔧 Working with AI tools like GPT, Gemini, Claude, Cursor, and Jules
- ⚙️ Tech Stack: **Python**, **PyQt**, **PHP**, **Django**, **React**, **Node.js**, **TailwindCSS**
- 🌐 Web: APIs, automation, web scraping, browser extensions, and desktop tools

> I like making tools that save people time. Nothing fancy — just things that work.
